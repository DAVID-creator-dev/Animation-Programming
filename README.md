# Animation Project in C++

This project allows you to visualize and interact with walking and running animations on a neutral UE model and its skeleton, using several real-time tools.

## Controls

| **Key**                     | **Action**                                                |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `W` / `A` / `S` / `D`       | Move the camera (forward, left, backward, right)          |
| **Mouse (movement)**        | Rotate the camera to view the animation from any angle    |
| `↑` (Up Arrow)              | Increase animation speed                                  |
| `↓` (Down Arrow)            | Decrease animation speed                                  |
| `←` (Left Arrow)            | Switch between walk and run animations with smooth blending |
| `→` (Right Arrow)           | Play the animation in reverse (rewind)                    |

## Main Features

- **Adjustable playback speed**: examine animation sequences in detail.  
- **Smooth blending** between walking and running animations.  
- **Reverse playback** for full animation control.

---

## Purpose

This project demonstrates skeletal animation handling and visualization in C++, including:
- animation playback and interpolation,
- blending between multiple animation states,
- real-time camera and playback control.
